# Professional Gym Management System

A sleek and modern web application for managing gym members, trainers, classes, and schedules. This project is built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate core web development skills.

- **Trainer Profiles**: A dedicated section to showcase gym trainers and their specialties.
- **Class Schedule**: A simple table to display and manage the weekly class schedule.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive design for a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.

The project is divided into three main files:
